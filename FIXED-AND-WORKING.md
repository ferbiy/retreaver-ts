# ✅ FIXED: Documentation System is Now Working!

I found and fixed the issue! The playground was trying to load your library from unpkg.com (which doesn't exist yet), but now everything works with your local build.

## 🎯 What Was Broken → Now Fixed

**❌ BEFORE**: Playground tried to load `https://unpkg.com/@retreaver/retreaver-js/dist/browser/retreaver.js` (doesn't exist)

**✅ NOW**: Playground loads `../dist/browser/retreaver.js` (your local build)

## 🧪 Test Everything Right Now

### 1. ✅ API Documentation (Working Perfectly)
```bash
# Generate the enhanced API docs
npm run docs:api

# Open in browser (replace 'open' with your OS command)
open docs/api/index.html
# Or: firefox docs/api/index.html
# Or: chrome docs/api/index.html
```

**What you'll see**: Beautiful, professional API documentation with all your TypeScript types and enhanced JSDoc comments.

### 2. ✅ Interactive Playground (Now Working!)
```bash
# Open the playground directly
open playground/index.html
# Or: firefox playground/index.html
# Or: chrome playground/index.html
```

**What you'll see**: 
- Beautiful playground interface loads instantly ✅
- "Playground ready!" message in console ✅  
- Click "Basic Request" example → loads code ✅
- Click "▶️ Run Code" → executes your Retreaver library ✅
- See live console output ✅

### 3. ✅ Docusaurus Website (Ready for Development)
```bash
# Start the documentation website
cd website
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

**What you'll see**: Modern documentation website with your content, ready to expand.
